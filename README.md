# What?
This is a cheat for TF2C, mostly for bot-hosting/multi-boxing. This was supposed to be a private "cheat", but i have basically no use for this, since im banned from every single TF2C server, and im too lazy to make more accounts to bot-roll

# How to host TF2C Multi-Box Bots.
Get Sandboxie, make boxes, run steam in them, launch TF2C on that box, inject the dll, config it. Thats it.
